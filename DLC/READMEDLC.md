To guide you, you can you can look at the .yaml configuration files which include the settings chosen to train the model. 
You can also access codes for 2D and 3D trajectory estimation with DeepLabCut (2dDLC and 3dDLC respectively).
Finally, the "ManualTraingulation" code allows us to obtain the 3D coordinates of our bees, without going through a calibration (based on the same X axis of the image of the camera without mirror and with mirror [see my memoir for more informations]).
