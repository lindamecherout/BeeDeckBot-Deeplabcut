# Project presentation

My work follows the work of Lina LeGuellec's final year of engineering studies (which can be consulted at this link https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/). The objective of this project is to study, using DeepLabCut (https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut), the 3D trajectory of bees when they land on a robot flower.

# Folders organization
- The "DLC" folder contains the code that integrates DeepLabCut's algorithms for pose estimation in 2D and 3D, with parameters adjusted thanks to simulations carried out with a fake 3D printed bee.
- "Fig" contains the codes making it possible to obtain the basic figures making it possible to analyze the coherence of the model in particular.
- "ImageTreatment" with the codes allowing us to process our images before using them with DeepLabCut.
- "MotorsAndCameraControl" conrains the arduino algorithm for motor and camera simultaneous control.
- "Stats" includes the various codes of the statistics contained in my memoir.
- "anipose" contains the test made with anipose (https://github.com/lambdaloop/anipose), an alternative of DeepLabCut.
- "impression 3D" contains the fusion 360 project, like the fake bee.
- "memoirMasterNeurosciencesBehavorialSciences" contains, as indicated the name of the folder, my memoir.
