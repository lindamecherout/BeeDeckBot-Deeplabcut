# Tutorial
You can access to the anipose tutorial here : https://anipose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

# Folder contents
To guide you, you can you can look at the .toml configuration files which include the settings chosen to train the model.

# Advantages
The use of anipose was considered as an alternative to DeepLabCut. Indeed, this algorithm allows the use of more than two cameras at distant viewing angles, to calibrate and triangulate to obtain 3D coordinates. DeepLabCut would only be able to do 3D stereoscopy according to their documentation.

# But,
anipose is a recent tool which still lacks a tutorial and documentation, its use can be complex. In particular, we encountered calibration problems with several and various image captures, we still haven't yet understood the problem or resolved it.
So, our final choice fell on DeepLabCut.
